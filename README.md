# This first fractal tree,
is just some crappy beginner's code.
Seriously, I don't know what I'm doing, save me.
Letting my rant aside,
it's a fractal tree, made out of draw-functions iterations.
I think it's pretty cool... isn't it?
To visualize my (and Dalmolax) animations go to https://github.com/BruniGui/First-Fractal-Tree/ and add the wanted version (v.1/,v.2/,v.3/, etc.)
