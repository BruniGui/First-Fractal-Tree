# This first fractal tree,
is just some crappy beginner's code.
Seriously, I don't know what I'm doing, save me.
Letting my rant aside,
it's a fractal tree, made out of draw-functions iterations.
I think it's pretty cool... isn't it?
To visualize my (and Dalmolax) animations go to https://brunigui.github.io/First-Fractal-Tree/FractalTree.v and add the desired version (1/, 2/, 3/, etc.).
